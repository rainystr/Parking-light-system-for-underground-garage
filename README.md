In the field of indoor parking, there are many mature and large-scale applied parking space detection and guidance methods, such as ultrasonic parking space detection and parking space video camera detection. However, since these methods all have high requirements for on-site engineering and technical means, the implementation prices of landed projects are relatively high. For example, although the equipment for ultrasonic parking space detection is relatively simple, since it must be installed on the parking space using a bridge frame and parking is not allowed below during construction, it causes a small number of available parking spaces in the parking lot during old renovation installations, leading to parking disputes and contradictions, and 变相 increasing the construction cost and promotion difficulty. Another example is that the implementation of parking space camera detection not only requires the installation of bridge frames on both sides of the lane in both directions, but also requires comprehensive network cabling and switch equipment. In addition, on-site computing equipment for video recognition processing is needed to achieve video license plate capture and status interpretation. Moreover, during the construction process, roles such as software and hardware technicians and network cabling engineers need to be coordinated. This leads to the need for different skilled engineering technicians to be on site for each project. And after each project passes the warranty period, the implementation of new projects cannot be landed due to high costs, and the maintenance of old projects is also unbalanced in interests due to the coordination of multiple parties.

In addition, due to the complexity of engineering implementation and technical requirements of parking space detection schemes, many projects cannot be implemented in other places. For example, most parking space detection scheme companies are located along the coast, and it is difficult to obtain technical manpower support to implement projects on the site. Moreover, the expenses for business trips often cannot be covered by the project budget, all of which make it difficult to reasonably meet the demand for parking space detection and guidance.

In addition, since the lighting system and the parking system belong to two different industries, parking space detection and lighting indication cannot be uniformly applied. Although due to the convenience of taking power for lighting fixture installation, the idea and attempt of using parking lot lighting fixtures as parking space detection carriers have always existed. But currently, there are corresponding difficulties and problems when implanting traditional parking space sensors into lighting fixtures. So except for the scheme of adding ultrasonic detection to lighting fixtures on the market, there is no other scheme implemented.

For the current camera scheme on the market that can recognize license plates and parking spaces, it must be installed on the other side of the driving lane during installation to obtain a more suitable angle to see the car license plate. This installation method does not match the installation method on the same side as the parking space lighting fixture and parking space. Even if only the parking space occupancy situation is recognized without recognizing the license plate, due to the serious mismatch between the parking space camera scheme and the hoisting method of lighting fixtures, the hoisted lighting fixtures are easily affected by wind disturbance or vehicle driving vibrations, which will cause the frame difference calculation between the captured pictures of the camera to be unable to meet the judgment, making the parking space camera unable to be integrated with lighting fixtures.

For the ultrasonic parking space sensor scheme, its ultrasonic beam working distance is generally 1-2 meters, so it can only work normally if it is emitted vertically downward above the parking space area. If it is to be integrated into lighting fixtures, only simply adding ultrasonic sensing to lighting fixtures has no substantial breakthrough in installation complexity and functional innovation, and it is difficult to form convenience. For example, for the existing strip-shaped lighting fixtures with integrated ultrasonic sensing, when installed, strip-shaped lighting fixtures for parking space detection need to be installed in the parking space area, and at the same time, strip-shaped lighting fixtures for channel indication need to be installed in the lane area. For an area of three parking spaces, often at least two parking space lighting fixtures plus one lane lighting fixture are required, resulting in the construction workload being basically the same as or higher than that of the previous ultrasonic detection bridge frame installation. And due to the increase in the number of lighting fixtures, its overall energy consumption is even higher, and the landing engineering and equipment cost exceeds the general ultrasonic parking space detection scheme. If a microwave directional ranging beam with stronger power is used to detect parking spaces from the driving lane, more beam dispersion will inevitably occur when the microwave beam rebounds through the curved surface of the car during operation, thereby interfering with the detection work of microwave sensors on other surrounding parking spaces, and it is not suitable for large-scale application.

For other parking space detection sensors, such as geomagnetic sensors, due to the large amount of reinforced metal in underground garages affecting magnetism, and even the presence of subways passing through urban buildings, geomagnetic sensors are also interfered with and cannot be used for parking, and even less can be integrated with lighting fixtures. Precisely because the parking space sensors used in the previous parking industry cannot be reasonably integrated with the installation and function realization of lighting fixtures, there has been no feasible method proposed on the market on which parking space detection sensor should be used to effectively realize the linkage of lighting indication and parking space in lighting fixtures, and it has always remained in the possible imagination and has not been truly implemented in field applications.

In order to make urban parking environments more convenient, solve the dilemma of difficult underground parking, and promote the integration of parking detection and lighting, after continuous verification based on actual sites and integrated functional requirements, the present invention proposes the use of a photoelectric sensor combined with an enhanced self-learning algorithm to construct special parking lighting fixtures and realize long-distance detection of corresponding parking spaces on both sides of the driving lane. The reason for finally choosing a photoelectric sensor is, first of all, that the working distance is far enough, with a maximum working range of 6-7 meters, which is completely suitable for installation scenarios with various lighting fixture distribution differences in parking lots. Secondly, the photoelectric sensor uses the iToF detection and ranging principle, uses phase frequency to avoid interference between multiple photoelectric sensors, and can also avoid a certain amount of spectral interference in natural light, which is conducive to large-scale on-site installation work. Finally, the photoelectric sensor has good directivity and stable beam shaping. The detection results of the parking space ground and the car surface can be regarded as direct targeting results, and invisible and intangible fuzzy evaluations can be avoided during installation.

With the rapid development of vehicle upgrading and urban construction, the connected car networking capabilities are advancing by leaps and bounds. Cars are also developing and promoting automatic parking functions, enabling smart cars to use the previous fixed parking space path parking operation records in the basement and realize autonomous parking of smart cars in underground parking lots through lidar and video recognition capabilities. So far, most mainstream smart cars have this function. But this kind of function is only suitable for parking scenarios with previous manual operation memories. For previously unseen scenarios, manual operation is still needed and it cannot flexibly and autonomously find and park. Therefore, for unknown underground garage scenarios, the real-time information of the real-time parking space vacancy distribution situation combined with electronic maps or BIM is crucial, which can help smart cars realize priority calculation of basement paths in advance and quickly implement the complete function of autonomous driving and parking. Synchronously, for manual parking operations, more intelligent lighting guidance is also needed. Through the flashing of side flowing lights of linear lighting fixtures on both sides of the lane line, the intelligent identification of the on-site parking movement line is realized, helping car owners reach convenient parking areas faster and more clearly and avoiding waste of time caused by excessive searching for parking spaces.

The parking space linkage system in the prior art does not use special parking lighting fixtures, Internet of Things gateways, the background of the Internet parking management system, smart in-vehicle machine App programs and mobile phone App programs to help connected cars and manual driving achieve parking space linkage in underground garages, and it is difficult to break the previous conventional thinking to achieve fast and efficient parking convenience. Therefore, in view of this current situation, there is an urgent need to develop a parking space linkage system that uses indoor lighting fixtures to achieve automatic and manual driving assistance to meet the actual usage needs.

In view of this, in view of the deficiencies in the existing technology, the main purpose of the present invention is to provide a parking space linkage system that uses indoor lighting fixtures to achieve automatic and manual driving assistance. By using special parking lighting fixtures, Internet of Things gateways, the background of the Internet parking management system, smart in-vehicle machine App programs and mobile phone App programs to help connected cars and manual driving achieve parking space linkage in underground garages. It is an excellent product scheme that breaks the previous conventional thinking. The overall system design is simple, the implementation project is simple, and it has practical value for connected cars to link parking spaces in indoor underground garages. The implementation is simple, economical and reliable, and easy to be deployed and installed on a large scale.

在室内停车领域，已有很多成熟且规模化应用的车位检测及引导方法，如超声波车位检测，车位视频相机检测等方法。但由于这些方法都对现场工程和技术手段要求较高，造成落地项目实现价格都较为高昂。例如，超声波车位检测的设备虽然较为简单，但由于其必须使用桥架在车位上安装，施工时下方不能停车，造成很多旧改安装时车场的可用车位数量较少引发停车矛盾纠纷，变相的增加了施工成本和推广难度。又例如，车位相机检测的实现，不仅需要车道两侧双向需要架设桥架，还需要综合网络布线和交换机设备，另外还需要视频识别处理的现场计算设备来实现视频车牌捕获和状态判读，而且施工过程中需要软硬件技术人员，网络布线工程师等角色进行协调。这就导致每个项目往往需要不同技能的工程技术人员驻场，且每个项目过了质保期后，新项目的落实会由于成本高昂而无法落地，旧项目的维护保养也由于涉及多方人员协调而利益不均衡。

此外，由于车位检测的方案在工程实现和技术要求的复杂，也导致很多项目无法在外地落实，例如绝大部分车位检测方案公司都在沿海一带，场地难以得到技术人力的支持来实现项目，而派遣出差的费用往往更是无法被项目预算所覆盖，这都造成了车位检测和引导的需求难以被合理满足。

此外，由于照明系统与停车系统分属两个行业，造成车位检测和照明指示无法统一应用。虽然由于灯具安装取电的便利性，使用停车场照明灯具作为车位检测载体的想法和尝试一直存在。但目前传统车位传感器要植入照明灯具都有相应的困难和问题，所以市场上除了有将超声波检测加入灯具的方案外，并没有其他方案实现落地。

目前市场上可识别车牌和车位的相机方案，其安装时必须在行车道的另一侧，以此获得较合适可以看到汽车车牌的角度，这种安装方式与车位照明灯具和车位同侧安装方式不匹配。即便不用识别车牌而单纯识别车位停车占位情况，车位相机方案由于和照明灯具吊装方式存在严重的不匹配，吊装的灯具容易受到风扰或车辆行驶产生抖动会造成相机采集图片之间的帧差计算无法满足判断，使得车位相机也无法与照明灯具实现融合。

对于超声波车位传感器方案，其超声波束工作距离一般1-2米，所以只能在车位区域上方垂直朝下发射才可以工作正常。如果要融合到照明灯具上，只能简单将超声波传感加入到照明灯具，在安装复杂性和功能创新上未有实质性突破，难以形成便利。例如，现有使用集成超声波传感的条形灯具，其安装时需要在车位区域安装车位检测的条形灯具，同时还需要在车道区域上安装通道指示的条形灯具，这样3个车位的区域，往往需要最少2个车位灯具加上1个车道灯具，导致施工工程量比之前的超声波检测桥架安装基本一样或更高，且由于灯具数量增加的原因，其整体能耗反而更高，落地工程和设备成本更超过一般的超声波车位检测方案。如果采用功率更强的微波定向测距波束从行车道来检测车位，微波波束在工作过程经过汽车表面曲面反弹会不可避免产生更多的波束逸散，从而干扰周边其他车位上的微波传感器的检测工作，是不适合大规模应用的。

对于其他的车位检测传感器，例如地磁传感器，由于地下车库里大量的钢筋金属影响磁性，甚至城市建筑里有地铁穿行，也造成地磁传感器受到干扰而无法用于停车，更无法融合灯具。正由于之前停车行业所采用的车位传感器，都无法与照明灯具安装及功能实现合理融合，市场上一直没有提出该采用何种车位检测传感器在照明灯具有效实现照明指示车位联动的可行方法，一直停留在想象认为的可能，未实现真正的现场应用。

为了更加便利城市停车环境，解决地下停车难的困境，促进停车检测和照明一体化，在基于实际现场和融合功能需求的不断验证后，本发明才提出使用结合增强型自学习算法的光电传感器，构建特种停车灯具，在行车道两侧对相应车位进行远距离检测的实现方式。之所以最终选择光电传感器的原因，首先是工作距离足够远，可达6-7米的最大工作范围，完全适合停车场内各种灯具布点差异安装的场景。其次，光电传感器使用iToF检测测距原理，利用相位频率来规避多个光电传感器之间的干扰，同时也可以规避一定的自然光线中的光谱干扰，利于现场大批量安装工作。最后，光电传感器定向性能好，光束成型稳定，对车位地面和汽车表面的检测结果可以看作直接靶向结果，在安装中可以避免看不见摸不着的模糊评估。

随着汽车更新换代和城市建设的飞速发展，现在智能汽车网联能力突飞猛进，汽车也在开发推广自动泊车功能，使得智能汽车可以利用之前地库的固定车位路径停车操作记录，并通过激光雷达及视频识别能力实现智能汽车在地下停车场的自主停车。到目前为止，绝大部分主流智能汽车都具备该功能。但此种功能只适合曾经有过人工操作记忆的泊车场景，如果对于之前未来过的场景，还是需要依赖人工操作，不可灵活自主寻找并停泊。所以对于未知的地下车库场景，场内实时车位空余分布态势的实时信息与电子地图或BIM结合就至关重要，可以帮助智能汽车提前实现地库路径优先计算和快速落实自动驾驶停车的完整功能。同步的，对于人工停车操作，也需要更加智能化的照明灯光引导，通过车道线两侧的线性灯具的侧面流光灯闪烁实现场内停车动线的智能化标识，帮助车主更快更明确的到达便利停车区域，避免过度找寻车位造成时间浪费。

现有技术中的车位联动系统未采用特种停车灯具、物联网关、互联网停车管理系统后台、智能车载机App程序和手机端App程序帮助智能网联汽车及人工驾驶实现地下车库的车位联动，难以打破以往常规思路实现快捷高效的泊车便利；因此，针对此现状，迫切需要开发一种利用室内照明灯具实现自动及人工驾驶辅助的车位联动系统，以满足实际使用的需求.

有鉴于此，本发明针对现有技术存在之缺失，其主要目的是提供一种利用室内照明灯具实现自动及人工驾驶辅助的车位联动系统，其通过采用特种停车灯具、物联网关、互联网停车管理系统后台、智能车载机App程序和手机端App程序帮助智能网联汽车及人工驾驶实现地下车库的车位联动，是打破以往常规思路的优秀产品方案；整体系统设计简洁，落地实现工程简单，对网联汽车对室内地下车库车位联动具有实用价值；落实简单，经济可靠，易于大规模部署安装。
